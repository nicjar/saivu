## The mystery

*Soon after we started to get into the mountain, the setbacks began to come one after the other. Tunnels that were started suddenly collapsed for no apparent reason. Several miners fell ill. Equipment broke down. To date, we have made very little progress. I know it is much to ask of you to come to me here in the wilderness. But if we do not resolve this situation, we are lost!*

An old childhood friend asks for help in solving a series of unexplained events at a newly started mine high up north in the Swedish mountains. The player characters confronts a type of Vaesen they have never encountered before, and that they might have to travel to another world to contact.

The mystery centres around racism and colonialism towards the Sami, and the player characters have to choose if they should be loyal to the Swedes or solve the mystery by helping a group of Sami.
