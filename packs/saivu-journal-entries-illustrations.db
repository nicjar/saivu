In addition, it protects the owner from evil forces and ill health.</p>\n<p>This particular knife is a magic item with trollcraft THOUGHT VIRUS (OBSERVATION) and MAGIC 8 (see rule book p120 and 122). The knife can be used to change reality so that what is said becomes true for those who are exposed to the trollcraft - e.g. that there is no iron ore in Glibbo. The knife can be used 2 times, but it only retains its magical power in the area around Glibbo. If it is used a second time, there is a risk of the user of the knife being negatively affected (1 on a 1D6 roll results in critical mental injury).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>@Item[aGOjWag5wP5a3F5D]{Niibi}</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/vaesen-saivu/assets/images/Niibi.png","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"cank31BwC0G1n32h":3},"flags":{}}
