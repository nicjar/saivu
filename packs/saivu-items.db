The knife can be used to change reality so that what is said becomes true for those who are exposed to the trollcraft - e.g. that there is no iron ore in Glibbo. The knife can be used 2 times, but it only retains its magical power in the area around Glibbo. If it is used a second time, there is a risk of the user of the knife being negatively affected (1 on a 1D6 roll results in critical mental injury).","category":"trollcraft"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"cank31BwC0G1n32h":3},"flags":{}}
