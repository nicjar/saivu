He and the other Sami are very vigilant, and extremely reserved towards the Swedes. The PCs really need to convince them that they have good intentions in order to get any information out of them. This will not succeed at the beginning of the mystery.</li><li>Few Sami speak Swedish, and those that do will not show that they know how. The only way to talk to them is to get one of the @Actor[Ux1zegjyOdjiZWFQ]{Gakko} brothers to interpret. The noaidi @Actor[X22fEj0PegTpGYlF]{Sikká Halt} can speak Swedish, but will not make this clear until she is sure of the PCs' intentions.</li><li>If conversations touch on faith and Vaesen, they will at first emphasize that they only believe in the teachings of the Church of Sweden, and nothing else.</li><li>After the PCs arrive, but before the countdown begins, the @Actor[qEZGnDyW5ZqCVOdE]{Háldi} shows herself to the noaidi Sikká, and tells her that the desecration of the saivva must cease. The PCs might spot the Háldi in connection with this, and understand that she is a Vaesen (VIGILANCE).</li><li>Step 2 of the @UUID[JournalEntry.wJ6AOAUAjvYmDIgH.JournalEntryPage.thA1wJeyrgHztTgP]{COUNTDOWN} occurs and Máret's delivery starts at the same time as Josefina’s. Like Josefina's, Máret's condition is not good. If the Sami have not contacted the PCs already, they do so now. No more than two of the PCs will be let into the tent where Máret is giving birth. There are only women in there, but they will not object if a male character helps out with the birth (although it will be obvious that they think it is strange). The noaidi Síkka is also there, and will speak to them in Swedish. The PCs can make a MEDICINE test. Regardless of whether it succeeds or not, Máret survives and will recover (but the PC do not need to know this). The person who delivers the child rolls a D2 for whether it is a girl or a boy (1: girl, 2: boy). In the same way as for Josefina and Herman's child, it is discovered the next morning that the child is not as it should be.</li></ul><h3>CLUES</h3><ul><li>Síkka will select one of the PCs, preferably an occultist if there is one in the group, otherwise a doctor. This happens at the latest during the childbirth, but can also happen earlier if it fits the story. The gamemaster can indicate this by Síkka giving the PC a penetrating look.</li><li>If the characters helped out with delivery of Máret, Síkka will soon after contact the PC she has selected. She will tell that PC that he or she must accompany her on a journey down to Sáivu through a ritual, to appease the Háldi and certify that the blame for the violation does not lie with the Sami (see @JournalEntry[Confrontation#The journey to Sáivu]). In order to perform the ritual, the characters must first find and return the @Item[ncZuh8qBwfiK09xR]{drum} that the priest has stolen from Síkka.</li></ul></div></div></div></div></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.idreTz54zO85RTVn.JournalEntryPage.nDjJ6rCLz8mHtRuX"}}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"vaesen","systemVersion":"3.0.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672857652460,"modifiedTime":1672857652460,"lastModifiedBy":"cank31BwC0G1n32h"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"cank31BwC0G1n32h":3}}

Technical advances in industry and transport makes it profitable to extract metals from existing natural resources. The construction of a railway - Malmbanan - between Luleå on the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia and Gällivare-Malmberget makes it economically possible to transport the iron ore to the ironworks. The mining industry will thus become a significant part of what, together with the forestry industry and hydropower, will build Sweden's prosperity for a long time to come. Most of these natural resources are located in a cultural area called Sápmi, the region where the Sami people have traditionally lived. Sápmi stretches over regions of four countries: Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. This exploitation of the natural resources in Sápmi is done completely without taking those who have lived and worked in the area for many hundreds of years into account. The legislation has for a long time marginalized and made invisible the rights of the Sami, which means that they have no opportunity to protect their rights, or to receive compensation for the interventions in the landscape in which they live and earn their living.</span></p><div title=\"Page 3\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:rgb(65, 32, 23);font-family:Baskerville, serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-color:initial\"><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin:0.5em 0px\"><span style=\"font-family:Baskerville, serif\">At the Glibbo mountain (“Klibbotjåck”), far north, the engineer Herman Jernberg and his wife Josefina have found what is believed to be a large iron ore deposit. Both are dedicated rock engineers who were hiking together in the mountains to search for iron ore deposits. When they find the iron ore in Glibbo, they invest most of their own financial assets. Herman also succeeds in persuading rich, but unscrupulous, financiers to invest a large sum of money to start Jernbergen AB and establish a mine under the Glibbo mountain. The financiers expect a large and quick return, which puts pressure on Jernberg to get the mine up and running quickly.</span></p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin:0.5em 0px\"><span style=\"font-family:Baskerville, serif\">Jernberg has now hired a number of miners to establish the mine, a foreman Johan Orre, and a couple of forest Sami to act as guides and transport equipment. The Church of Sweden has appointed a priest to be responsible for the miners' spiritual welfare. In addition to a timbered cottage for Jernberg, the miners have built a small village of simple earthen huts. A small chapel has been built on a promontory in the nearby lake. The forest Sami have set up their lavvu (Sami tent hut) some distance from the miners' houses. Herman also has his pregnant wife Josefina, who is also an engineer, with him.</span></p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin:0.5em 0px\"><span style=\"font-family:Baskerville, serif\">Glibbo is a sájvva (holy mountain, holy lake) for the Sami, that is home to a <a class=\"content-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-type=\"Actor\" data-uuid=\"Actor.qEZGnDyW5ZqCVOdE\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;cursor:pointer;background:none;padding:0px;border:none;border-radius:2px;white-space:nowrap;word-break:break-all;color:rgb(64, 32, 23);text-decoration:none\">Háldi</a>, a protective spirit. A shallow cave has served as a sacrificial site for the Sami when they pass on their spring and autumn ráidus. Every time the Sami pass the sajvva, they thank the Háldi for the protection she has given them since the last time, and sacrifice to her for continued protection.</span></p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin:0.5em 0px\"><span style=\"font-family:Baskerville, serif\">To establish the entrance to the mine, the miners have demolished and thrown out the more than waist-high sacrificial mound of reindeer antlers that has built up for several hundred years. Coins and handicrafts that have been sacrificed have been taken by the miners and the priest. Attempts have since been made to establish mining tunnels from the shallow cave. The intrusion into the rock and the demolition of the sacrificial mound is of course a desecration of the holy place, which has made the Háldi furious. The Háldi has affected the mining business with various enchantments - mining tunnels have collapsed and miners have been affected by disease. The foreman Johan Orre suspects that this has other than logical reasons, and therefore contacts an old friend who is a member of the Society to get help with the situation (see INVITATION).</span></p><div title=\"Page 4\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\"><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin:0.5em 0px\"><span style=\"font-family:Baskerville, serif\">Earlier in the day, before the player characters arrive (see JOURNEY), a sita (a group of Sami who take care of their reindeer together) on their annual spring or autumn ráidu has arrived at the site because the area offers good grazing for their herd of reindeers, and to sacrifice and show their reverence to the Háldi to ask for continued protection. They are, of course, appalled to see their usual campsite occupied by the mining village and the sacrificial site desecrated. But instead of moving on, they pitch their tents a bit away, as Máret Alit, the wife of the leader of the sita Niilá Alit, is very close to giving birth to her first child. The priest Otto Thulin visits them as soon as they arrive to inquire about how their church attendance is going. The Sami then express their dissatisfaction with what the miners have done, but he ignores them. He also searches their possessions, and confiscates the goavddis (drum) of the noaidi Sikká. The discovery of the \"troll drum\" makes him extremely angry - \"That the use of these tools of the devil still persists is outrageous!\".

Should the conversation touch on the Sami, the priest will discourage them from having anything all to do with them. After the dinner, it is possible for the PCs to engage some miners in conversation (and drinking), or to look around for clues, although the dark will make it hard to find much.

On the way, they enter Hudiksvall, Sundsvall and Umeå, before arriving in the evening the day after departure.</p><p>The next morning, they take the train on the newly built Malmbanan between Luleå and Gällivare-Malmberget, where they arrive in the afternoon.</p><p>The last stage is a two-day trek on foot / skis (depending on whether it is spring or autumn) (see ARRIVAL).</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.wJ6AOAUAjvYmDIgH.JournalEntryPage.SXS5BkQQz0nk7khz"}}},{"sort":297657,"name":"ARRIVAL","type":"text","_id":"YUlhHFzZBAyjzdkl","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div title=\"Page 3\"><div title=\"Page 3\"><div title=\"Page 4\"><div title=\"Page 5\"><div><div><div title=\"Page 6\"><div><div><p>The player characters are met by the Gakko brothers when they arrive at the train station in Gällivare in the morning.

During the first day it is mostly deep forest with tall spruces and pines. During the second day, the forest becomes lower and sparser, with more and more mountain birch, and eventually thickets of willow, the higher up and further west they come. In the afternoon the view opens up even more with @JournalEntry[XxJ63dpXB9aBVhlk]{views of the magnificent mountain landscape}. It is becoming obviously clear what the final destination is - the Glibbo mountain that towers in the distance.</p><div title=\"Page 6\"><div><div><p>When the player characters finally arrive at Glibbo towards the end of the second day, it starts to get dark. The settlement is a disappointing sight. Small hastily built timber huts surrounded by trampled mud that contrasts sharply with the beautiful mountain nature around them. Johan Orre and Herman Jernberg receive them. Orre is extremely relieved to see his childhood friend. He immediately takes his childhood friend in the group aside, and says that he has told Jernberg and the others that the group are potential \"investors\" who have come to form an opinion about the mining project. This is because he knows that Jernberg and Thulin (although for different reasons) would not approve of a group of people coming to investigate the supernatural causes of their problems.</p></div></div></div><p>Jernberg puts on a cheerful face and gives the guests a hearty welcome. There is no place for the characters to live in any of the huts, but the Gakko Brothers help them put up the lavvu tent in which they spent the night during the last stage of the journey. Herman and Josefina invite the company for dinner in their log cabin, at which Johan Orre and the priest Otto Thulin also participate. </p></div></div></div></div></div></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.wJ6AOAUAjvYmDIgH.JournalEntryPage.YUlhHFzZBAyjzdkl"}}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"vaesen","systemVersion":"3.0.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672857652496,"modifiedTime":1672857652496,"lastModifiedBy":"cank31BwC0G1n32h"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"cank31BwC0G1n32h":3}}
